# 🚗 Smart Car Object Detection

This project implements a **real-time object detection system for smart cars**, capable of identifying and tracking objects on the road using deep learning. It processes video feeds and outputs annotated frames highlighting detected objects to assist with autonomous driving or driver-assist systems.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Real-time object detection on video streams
- ✅ Detection of pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and obstacles
- ✅ Uses YOLOv5 / YOLOv8 models for high accuracy
- ✅ Easy-to-extend codebase
- ✅ Saves annotated video output for visualization and analysis
